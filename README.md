# formik

Formik is a popular form library for React applications. It simplifies the process of building and managing forms by providing a set of powerful and intuitive features. Formik helps with form state management, form validation, form submission handling, and overall form handling experience.

1. The initialValues is an object that represents the initial values of the form fields.

```javascript
const initialValues = {
  name: '',
  email: '',
  password: '',
  confirmPassword: '',
};

```
2. The validationSchema is created using Yup. It defines the validation rules for each form field. In this case, the name field is required, the email field must be a valid email address, the password field must be at least 8 characters long, and the confirmPassword field must match the password field.

```javascript
const validationSchema = Yup.object().shape({
  name: Yup.string().required('Name is required'),
  email: Yup.string().email('Invalid email address').required('Email is required'),
  password: Yup.string()
    .min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters')
    .required('Password is required'),
  confirmPassword: Yup.string()
    .oneOf([Yup.ref('password'), null], 'Passwords must match')
    .required('Confirm Password is required'),
});
```

The `handleSubmit` is a function that handles form submission. In this example, it simply logs the form data and resets the form by setting `setSubmitting` to `false`.

```javascript
const handleSubmit = (values, { setSubmitting }) => {
  // Perform form submission logic or API call
  console.log('Form data:', values);

  // Reset form after submission
  setSubmitting(false);
};
```
The setSubmitting function is provided by the Formik library as a parameter to the handleSubmit function. It allows you to control the submitting state of the form.
